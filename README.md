## Fedora Silverblue for Ubuntu Expatriates

This is a fork of [castrojo/ublue](https://github.com/castrojo/ublue) which configures the desktop to my liking. The main changes to the scripts are that 
I have removed applications and extensions which I wouldn't have installed on every system as a base. This aims to instead set up an ubuntu-like experience without perfectly matching it, while also removing some of the changes so that the defaults fit the liking of a more wide range of users. Varying from the original script, I have tried to install as little from rpm-ostree as possible, and instead encourage the use of distrobox to manage any other applications that aren't installed via flatpak. Below is the original README from castrojo.

TLDR: I've been using Ubuntu since 2004, however I want a [modern image based desktop](https://blog.verbum.org/2020/08/22/immutable-%E2%86%92-reprovisionable-anti-hysteresis/).
Can I have my cake and eat it too?
This is not a new distribution (whew!), just a different set of defaults and apps scripted up, with a dash of container goodies so I can still also use Ubuntu. 

- Check out my guest appearance on the [Linux Downtime podcast](https://www.youtube.com/embed/CiyjZwd4Jrs) to see how I ended up here.
- Check out [awesome-immutable](https://castrojo.github.io/awesome-immutable/) for a general list of systems like this, there's different ways to do this.

The intended audience are cloud leaning developers who use Linux desktops, the niche of the niche.
However it's also a great gaming setup, traditional desktop, or whatever you're using now because it's also just Fedora.
Realistically I don't want to maintain this longer than I have to, this is a crutch that I need and then at some point I'll end up on the default desktop.
The cloud image I'll need until I retire because old habits die hard and it's good.
If you're looking for a more reliable way to do this then [Jim Campbell's ansible playbook](https://github.com/j1mc/ansible-silverblue) is probably a good place to start.
Let's open our minds and do a mashup ...

## Scope

This is a proof-of-concept, ideally it's enough to get gears turning and starting conversations, it is by no means a a proper implementation. 
This POC is using Silverblue, but do check out [openSUSE's MicroOS](https://microos.opensuse.org/), alternative implementations of similar ideas is always a good idea.

If you want a more in depth view of what's happening I encourage you to take this apart and see what it's doing so you can learn about what I'm trying to do, and of course let me know about what you're building so we can celebrate. 


## Features

:heart: :heart: :heart: WARNING: You are changing system defaults and pushing more into the container land than usual, please be respectful of our OSS family and be thoughtful before filing issues with either Fedora or the maintainers of the cloud images. Thanks! 

[@mrckndt's playbook](https://github.com/mrckndt/silverblue-playbook) comes with some nice features that fit with our flow:

- rpm-ostree is set to stage updates by default, so it just does it automatically.
- systemd service units to update all the flatpaks four times a day to match the update cadence of Ubuntu 

If this scares you then you're in the wrong place, if you're ready to not only burn the ships but torpedo them just to make sure we don't end up back in the old world, read on.
I have selected a default set of apps that I use that I notice lots of other people use, feel free to change them up, it's only a default:

- Keep Ubuntu app defaults and panel layout
  - While this is a mashup, let's respect Ubuntu's choices here by default, you know how to change stuff
  - But add apps that the intended audience love and need like vscode
- Optionally install:
  - Work apps -  zoom, slack, standard notes, signal, riot, mailspring
  - Fun apps - discord and Steam (Last release of flatpak fixed many of Steam's issues, it works much better now, try it)
  - A selection of browsers - Firefox, Brave, Chrome, Edge
  - The excellent [Extensions Manager](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/01/gnome-extension-manager-app-easy-install) application is included to manage your GNOME extensions. Note that extensions.gnome.org won't work due to sandboxing, so this is a work around until all that is sorted in the future.

I replaced the distro Firefox with the flatpak from upstream.
As per upstream Silverblue, you want your apps to be either in containers (where you install them via apt/dnf) and your desktop apps to come via flatpaks. 

Maintenance: The gotcha is you gotta shutdown/reboot your PC on the regular (whatever matches your workflow).
This is the price the UNIX gods demand for the removal of dpkg-reconfigure -a from your life.
I just shut it down at the end of each workday. Your reward is little to zero host OS maintenance. 

### Desktop Changes

While upstream GNOME is fine I've been using a seb128-built desktop for most of my adult life, it's my home, so I made some changes. 

- Enabled appindicators since so many apps need them and they're useful
- Sound output switcher so that you can easily switch between headphones and speakers as you go from meeting to meeting
- Move the clock to the right - familiarity
- Dash-to-dock - familiarity, I default it to the left ubuntu-like setup
- gsconnect - Phone integration with my desktop is useful

This is not a distro, so no patches, etc, basically looking at the default setup in Ubuntu and mirroring it in Fedora.
Tailor to your taste.
I decided to use the distro packages for these extensions instead of snagging them from extensions.gnome.org. Sometimes these break so I turn off the version checking.
YOLO not my circus, not my monkeys.

## Instructions

1. Install [Fedora Silverblue](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/installation/) - probably don't do this on an existing system, just browse the repo and cherry pick if you're interested. 
1. On first boot, clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/castrojo/ublue.git`
1. `cd ublue`
1. Edit the `applications.list` and `applications-beta.list` files to your liking.
1. `./00-install-apps.sh`
1. Get a coffee, and then reboot your computer (Important!)
   - Read the [toolbx documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/toolbox/) and [README](https://github.com/containers/toolbox#readme), this will be useful later on. 
1. Run `./01-desktop.sh`
1. Optionally run the various scripts in `bits/` to install vscode, tailscale, and the ubuntu themes. We'll add little mini scripts here that are convenient for us.    

This script is terrible, it's written wrong, it doesn't check for anything properly, somethings still don't work, it basically a history file saved in a file.
Make something better, turn on github sponsors, and I'll be the first one sending you money on the regular.
Bring the cloud native dream to the people.
Just please, for the love of all that is holy, don't make another distro. 

To revert (and I mean, totally revert, you've been warned):

1. `./reset.sh` will reset the dconf database and ostree back to defaults and reboot you back to the stock Fedora experience. 

### Distrobox, your new user space

We've included [distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox). 
We'll use this to create our Ubuntu userspace:

    distrobox-create -i docker.io/library/ubuntu:20.04 -n ubuntu

You can use [any distribution image](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md#containers-distros) that is supported by distrobox (this is a bunch!) 
You can pull from any registry:

    distrobox-create -i public.ecr.aws/amazonlinux/amazonlinux:2022 -n amazon

Follow the instructions from distrobox to use your new userspace. Whichever distro you choose, you can use the "native" package manager in the box to install applications (including graphical ones), and we generally recommend doing most of your work in distrobox. You can also add the following config into your gnome-terminal to launch into your distrobox when you open a terminal:

Using any distribution as a container via your terminal is a very powerful feature as you can now use an install just about any package from any where. Check the [distrobox homepage](https://distrobox.privatedns.org/) for more info.

Note: Silverblue comes with [toolbx](https://github.com/containers/toolbox) by default, and it's still included. Check the `images/` directory for instructions on building your own images. Both projects use podman so it's a matter of taste, the base tech is the same. 

## VSCode and other developer notes
IDEs expect access to lots of stuff, we can either follow [this guide](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/posts/integrate_vscode_distrobox.md) to install it inside a Distrobox 
or using Flatpaks. Alternatively we compromise by overlaying vscode and directly adding the repo from upstream.
If using Toolbx instead of Distrobox, check out [this post](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/toolbox-and-visual-studio-code-remote-containers/27987) on setting up vscode with toolboxes, 
it might be useful for your workflow and is tracking issues with the various projects on what it would take to have vscode running as a flatpak but being able to directly access your toolboxes.

When you're inside a distrobox or a  toolbx you might be confused that you can't run containers from inside the toolbx. You can `alias podman="flatpak-spawn --host podman"` to let you call podman so you can fire up containers while still in your familiar toolbx.

This area needs work and is changing quickly!

## Todo

- Still can't set ctrl-alt-t to open a terminal lol. 
- Martin Pitt [has a script](https://piware.de/gitweb/?p=bin.git;a=blob;f=build-debian-toolbox) for building your own Debian/Ubuntu images on the spot if you want to do it by hand. (This is what I'm using now)
- Speaking of, here's advanced mode, and entire developer workflow living in git that can be splatted onto a machine:
